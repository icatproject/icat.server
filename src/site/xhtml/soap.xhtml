	<h1>Conventions</h1>
	In order to document the behaviour of the web service it generally
	described in terms of calls on a Java client and sometimes the Python
	equivalent is also shown where it is sufficiently different.

	<h1>Setting Up</h1>


	<p>The web service is accessed via a proxy (conventionally known in
		Java as a port). The proxy (here given a variable name of icat) may be
		obtained by the following:</p>

	<code>
		URL hostUrl = new URL("https://&lt;hostname&gt;:8181") <br /> URL
		icatUrl = new URL(hostUrl, "ICATService/ICAT?wsdl"); <br /> QName
		qName = new QName("http://icatproject.org", "ICATService"); <br />
		ICATService service = new ICATService(icatUrl, qName); <br /> ICAT
		icat = service.getICATPort();
	</code>

	<p>where &lt;hostname&gt; should be the full name of the ICAT
		server. For a secure installation, just specifying localhost will not
		work, the name must match what is on the host certificate.</p>

	<p>The corresponding Python suds code is:</p>

	<code>
		from suds.client import Client <br /> client = Client(url) <br />
		icat = client.service <br /> factory = client.factory <br />
	</code>
	<p>methods may then be invoked on the icat object and entities
		created using the factory.</p>


	<h1>Session management</h1>

	<p>When you login to ICAT you will be given back a string, the
		sessionId, which must be used as the first argument of almost all ICAT
		calls. The only exceptions being the login call itself, getEntityInfo
		and getApiVersion - none of which require authentication.</p>

	<p class="call">String login(String plugin, Credentials
		credentials)</p>

	<p>
		where the
		<tt>plugin</tt>
		is the mnemonic defined in the ICAT installation for the
		authentication plugin you wish to use and
		<tt>credentials</tt>
		is essentially a map. The names of the keys and their meaning is
		defined by the plugin.
	</p>

	<p>This sessionId returned will be valid for a period determined by
		the ICAT server.</p>

	<p>The example below shows how it works for the authn_db plugin at
		the time of writing, where the plugin has been given the mnemonic
		"db".</p>

	<code>
		Credentials credentials = new Credentials(); <br /> List&lt;Entry&gt;
		entries = credentials.getEntry(); <br /> Entry e; <br /> <br /> e =
		new Entry(); <br /> e.setKey("username"); <br /> e.setValue("root");
		<br /> entries.add(e); <br /> e = new Entry(); <br />
		e.setKey("password"); <br /> e.setValue("secret"); <br />
		entries.add(e); <br /> <br /> String sessionId = icat.login("db",
		credentials);
	</code>

	<p>The corresponding Python code, using the factory and icat
		service defined above is:</p>
	<code>
		credentials = factory.create("login.credentials") <br />
		<br /> entry = factory.create("login.credentials.entry") <br />
		entry.key = "username" <br /> entry.value = "root" <br />
		credentials.entry.append(entry) <br /> entry =
		factory.create("login.credentials.entry") <br /> entry.key =
		"password" <br /> entry.value = "secret" <br />
		credentials.entry.append(entry) <br />
		<br /> sessionId = icat.login("db", credentials) <br />
	</code>

	<p class="call">double getRemainingMinutes(String sessionId)</p>

	<p>This returns the number of minutes left in the session. A user
		may have more than one session at once.</p>

	<p class="call">String getUserName(String sessionId)</p>

	<p>This returns the string identifying the user of the session as
		provided by the authentication plugin.</p>

	<p class="call">void refresh(String sessionId)</p>
	<p>This resets the time-to-live of the session as it was when the
		session was first obtained.</p>

	<p class="call">void logout(String sessionId)</p>
	<p>This invalidates the sessionId.</p>



	<h1>Exceptions</h1>
	<p>There is only one exception thrown by ICAT. In the case of Java
		this is the IcatException_Exception which is a wrapper around the real
		exception which in turn includes an enumerated code to identify the
		kind of exception and the usual message. The codes and their meanings
		are:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>BAD_PARAMETER</dt>
		<dd>generally indicates a problem with the arguments made to a
			call.</dd>
		<dt>INTERNAL</dt>
		<dd>may be caused by network problems, database problems,
			glassfish problems or bugs in ICAT.</dd>
		<dt>INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGES</dt>
		<dd>indicates that the authorization rules have not matched your
			request.</dd>
		<dt>NO_SUCH_OBJECT_FOUND</dt>
		<dd>is thrown when something is not found.</dd>
		<dt>OBJECT_ALREADY_EXISTS</dt>
		<dd>is thrown when type to create something but there is already
			one with the same values of the constraint fields.</dd>
		<dt>SESSION</dt>
		<dd>is used when the sessionId you have passed into a call is not
			valid or if you are unable to authenticate.</dd>
		<dt>VALIDATION</dt>
		<dd>marks an exception which was thrown instead of placing the
			database in an invalid state.</dd>

	</dl>

	<p>For example to print what has happened you might use the
		following (in Java):</p>
	<code>
		String sessionId; <br /> try { <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; sessionId =
		icat.login("db", credentials); <br /> } catch
		(IcatException_Exception e) { <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; IcatException ue =
		e.getFaultInfo(); <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;
		System.out.println("IcatException " + ue.getType() + " " +
		ue.getMessage() <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; + (ue.getOffset() >= 0 ? " at
		offset " + ue.getOffset() : "")); <br /> }
	</code>

	<p>The corresponding Python code looks like:</p>
	<code>
		try: <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; sessionId = icat.login("db",
		credentials)<br /> except WebFault as e:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; etype =
		e.fault.detail.IcatException.type<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; message =
		e.fault.detail.IcatException.message<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; offset =
		e.fault.detail.IcatException.offset<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; print
		"IcatException " + etype + " " + message + (" at offset " + offset) if
		offset >= 0 else ""<br />
	</code>

	<p>Operations which work on a list of objects, such as createMany,
		may fail because of failure to process one of the objects. In this
		case the state of the database will be rolled back and the offset
		within the list of the entry causing the error will be stored in the
		IcatException. For other calls the offset will be negative, as it is
		with certain internal exceptions which are not associated with any
		specific object in a list.</p>


	<!-- <section name="Data Manipulation"> 


		</subsection>

		<subsection name="Creating an Object">
		<p class="call">long create(String sessionId, EntityBaseBean bean)
		</p>
		<p>To create an object in ICAT, first instantiate the object of
			interest, for example a Dataset, and then call the setters to set its
			attributes and finally make a call to create the object in ICAT.</p>
		<p>So typical code in Java might look like:</p>
		<code>
			Dataset ds = new Dataset(); <br /> ds.setName("Name of dataset"); <br />
			ds.set ... <br /> Long dsid = icat.create(sessionId, ds);
		</code>
		<p>You will see that no convenient constructors are generated,
			rather each field of the object must be set individually. Most fields
			are optional and may be left with null values, however some are
			compulsory and the call to create will fail if they are not set. Each
			object has a primary key that identifies it in the database - this is
			a value of type "long" that is generated by ICAT and is used to
			represent relationships in a regular manner.</p>
		<p>Some fields represent attributes of the object but others are
			used to represent relationships. The relationships are represented in
			the class definitions by a variable which either holds a reference to
			a single object or a list of objects. In the case of a list it may be
			"cascaded". Consider creating a dataset with a set of datafiles.
			Because the relationship from dataset to datafile is cascaded they
			may be created in one call as outlined below:</p>
		<code>
			Dataset ds = new Dataset(); <br /> ds.setName(dsName); <br />
			ds.setType(type); <br /> Datafile datafile = new Datafile(); <br />
			datafile.setDatafileFormat(format); <br /> datafile.setName(dfName);
			<br /> ds.getDatafiles().add(datafile); // Add the datafile to the
			dataset <br /> icat.create(sessionId, ds);
		</code>

		<p>The call to create returns the key of the created object. If
			you choose to write:</p>

		<code>ds.setId(icat.create(sessionId, ds));</code>

		<p>then the client copy of the Dataset will be updated to have the
			correct key value - however the keys in any other objects "within"
			the Dataset will still be null on the client side. In this case
			datafile.getId() will remain null.</p>

		<p>
			When creating multiple objects in one call, the value of the cascaded
			flag must be noted. The line
			<tt>ds.getDatafiles().add(datafile)</tt>
			requires that the datafile is not already in the ICAT database
			because the cascade flag is set. If the cascaded flag is set then
			objects to be included in the "create" operation must not exist.
			However if the cascaded flag is not set then objects which are being
			referenced must already exist in the ICAT database.
		</p>

		<p>
			It might help to understand what is happening when you call create.
			The client side object you pass in, and <em>everything it refers
				to </em> , is encoded as XML and sent to the server. There it is unpacked
			into the same set of objects and persisted in the database. The
			structure passed in must be a tree structure (or more correctly a <a
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph"
				target="_blank">DAG</a> ) - if, for example, you modify the code
			above to create a dataset with one datafile and add
			<tt>datafile.setDataset(dataset)</tt>
			attempting to put in a reverse link which physically will appear in
			the ICAT database the call will be rejected by the client because you
			have a loop in the graph as you can then go backwards and forwards
			between datafile and dataset. If you passed in a proper DAG the
			database will create one row in the dataset table and one in the
			datafile table where the datafile entry includes the field
			<tt>datafile.dataset_id</tt>
			holding the
			<tt>dataset.id</tt>
			of the dataset entry just created. Relationships are represented in
			the database by holding the id value of the related object.
		</p>

		<p>
			We now have an example of adding a datafile to an existing dataset,
			<tt>ds</tt>
		</p>
		<code>
			Datafile datafile = new Datafile(); <br />
			datafile.setDatafileFormat(format); <br /> datafile.setName(name); <br />
			datafile.setDataset(ds); // Relate the datafile to an existing
			dataset <br /> datafile.setId(icat.create(sessionId, datafile)); //
			Create datafile and store id on client side
		</code>

		<p>
			This is the only way to create a datafile - you cannot do it by any
			operation upon the dataset. After the call is made a new entry will
			have been been added to the datafile table in the database where
			again the field
			<tt>datafile.dataset_id</tt>
			in the database will have been set to the
			<tt>dataset.id</tt>
			of the related dataset which in this case may be more intuitive as it
			corresponds to the line of user code
			<tt>datafile.setDataset(ds)</tt>
			.
		</p>
		<p>It is worth noting that the dataset object you have in memory
			is not affected by the call to create a new datafile. More datafiles
			can be created referencing the same dataset without retrieving an
			updated copy of the dataset..</p>

		<p class="call">List &lt;Long&gt; createMany(String sessionId,
			List &lt;EntityBaseBean&gt; beans)</p>

		<p>This call, as its name suggests, creates many objects. It takes
			the list of objects to create and returns a list of ids. If any of
			the individual operations fail the whole call fails and the database
			will be unchanged. The objects to be created need not be of the same
			type. For an example (where they are of the same type) consider
			adding many Datafiles to a existing Dataset, ds:</p>
		<code>
			List &lt;Datafile&gt; dfs = new ArrayList&lt;Datafile&gt;(); <br />
			for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) { <br /> &#160;&#160;&#160;final
			Datafile datafile = new Datafile(); <br />
			&#160;&#160;&#160;datafile.setDatafileFormat(dfmt); <br />
			&#160;&#160;&#160;datafile.setName("bill" + i); <br />
			&#160;&#160;&#160;datafile.setDataset(ds); <br />
			&#160;&#160;&#160;dfs.add(datafile); <br /> } <br />
			icat.createMany(sesionId, dfs); // many datafiles are stored in one
			call <br />
		</code>

		<p>
			The only reason that this call exists is to minimize calls to ICAT as
			it is faster to call
			<tt>createMany</tt>
			than to make many calls to
			<tt>create</tt>
			.
		</p>

		<subsection name="Retrieving an object when you know its id">
		<p class="call">EntityBaseBean get(String sessionId, String query,
			long id)</p>

		<p>The first parameter is the sessionId, the second is a query
			string in either the JPQL style or the concise syntax and the last
			parameter is the id of the object. You may know the id of an object
			because you have created it or it was returned from a search call.
			For example:</p>
		<code>get(sessionId, "Dataset", 75L)</code>
		<p>will return the Dataset with an id of 75 or throw an exception
			if it is not found. The dataset is returned on its own; the set of
			related datafiles will be empty and the type will be null. Often
			however you will want to return more than just one object but will
			want to include related objects as well.</p>

		<a name="get_jpql_include"></a>
		<h4>JPQL style syntax for get calls with INCLUDEs</h4>

		<p>To get a Dataset with all its Datafiles you can have the query:
		</p>
		<code> Dataset ds INCLUDE ds.datafiles </code>
		<p>This uses the variable "ds" to identify the selected dataset.
			The field "datafiles" will be followed to include all those
			"Datafiles" related to the selected dataset. Those datafiles which
			the user is not allowed to read are silently ignored.</p>

		<p>To get a Dataset with all its Datafiles, DatasetParameters and
			DatafileParameters you can have the query:</p>

		<code>Dataset ds INCLUDE ds.datafiles df, df.parameters,
			ds.parameters</code>

		<p>which has introduced another variable df to represent the set
			of (readable) datafiles and which are related to the initial dataset
			ds. The variable could be preceded by the keyword "AS" if you feel
			this makes it easier to read as in:</p>

		<code>Dataset ds INCLUDE ds.datafiles AS df, df.parameters,
			ds.parameters</code>
		<p>To save typing you could write the equivalent:</p>

		<code>Dataset ds INCLUDE ds.datafiles.parameters, ds.parameters</code>
		<p>This slightly shortened form may make it less obvious that the
			datafiles are also included in the set of returned objects. In fact
			they must be present as the returned objects always form a DAG again
			and the DatafileParameters need the Datafiles to connect in to the
			structure.</p>

		<p>It is permissible to visit an entity type more than once in an
			INCLUDE - for example following a provenance chain or including the
			datasets with the same type as a particular dataset which would be:</p>

		<code>Dataset ds INCLUDE ds.type t, t.datasets</code> <a
			name="get_concise_include"></a>
		<h4>Concise syntax</h4>

		<p>If you want the Dataset along with its related Datafiles,
			DatasetParameters and DatafileParameters then in the concise syntax
			instead of giving the field to use for navigation from one object to
			another you simply list the set of types. as:</p>

		<code>Dataset INCLUDE
			Datafile,DatasetParameter,DatafileParameter</code>

		<p>
			The related types must be all be related to the original type or to
			some other type in the list. This means that you could not have
			<tt>"Dataset INCLUDE DatafileParameter"</tt>
			as there must be only one route from the original type to each of the
			included types - i.e. you can only construct one DAG from the
			starting object. There is evidently no way to express the query
			"dataset including the datasets with the same type as a particular
			dataset" as dataset appears twice. So you would need to use the JPQL
			style syntax.
		</p>

		</subsection>

		<subsection name="Updating an Object">
		<p class="call">void update(String sessionId, EntityBaseBean bean)</p>
		<p>To update an object simply update the fields you want to change
			and call update. For example:</p>
		<code>
			Dataset ds = (Dataset) icat.get(sessionId, "Dataset INCLUDE 1",
			dsid); <br /> ds.setInvestigation(anotherInvestigation); <br />
			icat.update(sessionId, ds);
		</code>
		<p>
			As suggested by the example above "many to one" relationships, such
			as the investigation relationship to the dataset, will be updated as
			will any simple field values. Consequently it is essential to get the
			existing values for any "many to one" relationships. This is most
			reliably achieved by the notation
			<tt>INCLUDE 1</tt>
			as shown here. The effect of the "1" is to include all "many to one"
			related types. "One to many" relationships are ignored by the update
			mechanism. Simple attributes may also be modified as:
		</p>
		<code>
			Dataset ds = (Dataset) icat.get(sessionId, "Dataset INCLUDE 1",
			dsid); <br /> ds.setName("Fred"); <br /> icat.update(sessionId,
			ds);
		</code>
		<p>
			Note that once again the
			<tt>INCLUDE 1</tt>
			is present to avoid losing "many to one" related objects. The name of
			the dataset is changed to "Fred". This is permissible even though
			<tt>name</tt>
			is one of the "uniqeness constraint" fields. If your attempted change
			violates a uniqeness constraint an exception will be thrown.
		</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="Deleting an Object">
		<p class="call">void delete(String sessionId, EntityBaseBean bean)</p>
		<p>The following code will get a dataset and delete it.</p>
		<code>
			Dataset ds = (Dataset) icat.get(sessionId, "Dataset", dsid); <br />
			icat.delete(sessionId, ds);
		</code>

		<p>
			All cascaded "one to many" related objects will also be deleted. In
			the extreme case, if you delete a facility, you lose everything
			associated with that facility. This privilege should not be given to
			many - see the <a href="#authorization">authorization</a> section
			later. When you get a local copy of the object to delete there is no
			need to use
			<tt>INCLUDE 1</tt>
			to populate the "one to many" related objects as all cascades will be
			followed. In fact the only part of the object that is used by the
			delete call is the id. So the following code will have the same
			effect and avoids one ICAT call:
		</p>
		<code>
			Dataset ds = new Dataset() <br /> ds.setId(dsid); <br />
			icat.delete(sessionId, ds);
		</code> </subsection>

		<subsection name="Searching for an Object">
	

		<p>
			The syntax is a standard JPQL "SELECT" statement with with two
			extensions a LIMIT clause and an INCLUDE clause which may come in
			either order <em>after</em> the standard JPQL. The only restriction
			is that returned item must be a set of entities, the result of an
			aggregate function (such as COUNT or MAX) or a set of values of one
			field of an entity type. If you use nested selects please define new
			variable names for use within such a construct. Some keywords, such
			as FETCH, are not relevant and are ignored. The language is too large
			to explain here but the <a
				href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/persistence-querylanguage.htm"
				target="_blank">Oracle JPQL documentation</a> is good.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are also two extensions to JPQL a LIMIT clause and an INCLUDE
			clause which may come in either order after the standard JPQL. The
			LIMIT clase follows MySQL syntax and takes the form:
			<code>LIMIT 10, 100</code>
			which will skip 10 results and return the next 100. A LIMIT clause
			will normally be used with an ORDER BY clause. The INCLUDE clause is
			just as as has been explained for the <a href="#get_jpql_include">get
				call with JPQL syntax</a> . A few examples are shown below:

		</p>

		<code> SELECT ds FROM Dataset ds INCLUDE
			ds.datafiles.parameters, ds.parameters </code>
		<p>This uses the variable "ds" defined in the FROM clause. It
			means that the "Dataset" field "datafiles" will be followed to
			include all those "Datafiles" and that for each "Datafile" the
			"parameters" field will be followed to get the "DatafileParameters".
			In addition the "DatasetParameters" will be included. A more
			interesting example is:</p>
		<code>SELECT ds.name FROM Dataset ds WHERE ds.type.name = 'GS'
			ORDER BY ds.name LIMIT 0, 10"</code>
		<p>This will take the first 10 datasets (as ordered by name) which
			have a type with a name of 'GS'. The next example (which cannot be
			expressed with the concise syntax) is looking for the ids of datasets
			which have both a parameter A1 > 50 and a parameter A2 > 20</p>
		<code>
			SELECT ds.id FROM Dataset ds, ds.parameters dp1, ds.parameters dp2
			WHERE <br /> dp1.type.name = 'A1' AND dp1.numericValue > 50 AND <br />
			dp2.type.name = 'A2' AND dp2.numericValue > 20
		</code>
		<p>
			Note in the example above how the parameters dp1 and dp2 were
			introduced. The form
			<tt>:user</tt>
			may be used to denote the currently authenticated user (derived from
			the sessionId). For example to see the investigations to which you
			are associated:
		</p>
		<code> SELECT i FROM Investigation i, i.investigationUsers ius
			WHERE ius.user.name = :user </code>
		<p>Time literals (which are implementation dependent in JPQL)
			should be expressed as shown in the next example:</p>
		<code> SELECT i FROM Investigation i WHERE i.createTime > {ts
			2011-01-15 00:00:00} </code>
		<p>The timestamp format must be exactly as shown. Literal boolean
			values are TRUE and FALSE as in:</p>
		<code>SELECT ds FROM Dataset ds WHERE ds.complete = TRUE</code>
		<p>and finally enums are expressed as shown below:</p>

		<code> SELECT pt FROM ParameterType pt WHERE pt.valueType =
			org.icatproject.ParameterValueType.DATE_AND_TIME </code>
		<p>
			which is selecting those ParameterTypes which have a valueType of
			ParameterValueType.DATE_AND_TIME. Note that the full class name
			<tt>org.icatproject.ParameterValueType</tt>
			must be specified.
		</p>

	
		
	

	

	</section>

	<section name="Authorization">
		<p>
			<a name="authorization" /> The mechanism is rule based. Rules allow
			groupings of users to do things. There are four things that can be
			done: Create, Read, Update and Delete. It makes use of five entity
			types: Rule, User, Grouping, UserGroup and PublicStep. The name
			"Grouping" has been introduced as "Group" is a reserved word in JPQL.
			The authentication mechanism authenticates a person with a certain
			name and this name identifies the User in the ICAT User table.
			Groupings have names and the UserGroup performs the function of a
			"many to many" relationship between Users and Groupings. Rules are
			applied to Groupings. There are special "root users" with full access
			to all entities. The set of "root users" is a configuration parameter
			of the ICAT installation. Only a root user can set up the initial set
			of authorization rules though these rules can then allow others to
			manipulate rules.
		</p>
		<subsection name="Rules" id="rules">
		<p>
			By default access is denied to all objects, rules allow access. It is
			only necessary to be permitted by one rule where that rule is only
			applied to the object referenced directly in the API call. The Rule
			table has two exposed fields:
			<tt>crudFlags</tt>
			and
			<tt>what</tt>
			. The field
			<tt>crudFlags</tt>
			contains letters from the set "CRUD" to indicate which types of
			operation are being allowed (Create, Read, Update and/or Delete). The
			other field,
			<tt>what</tt>
			, is the rule itself. There is also a "many to one" relationship to
			Group which may be absent.
		</p>
		<p>Consider:</p>
		<code>
			Rule rule = new Rule(); <br /> rule.setGroup(userOffice); <br />
			rule.setCrudFlags("CRUD"); <br /> rule.setWhat("Investigation"); <br />
			icat.create(sessionId, rule);
		</code>
		<p>allows members of the userOffice group full access to all
			Investigations.</p>
		<code>
			Rule rule = new Rule(); <br /> rule.setGroup(null); // Not necessary
			as it will be null on a newly created rule <br />
			rule.setCrudFlags("R"); <br /> rule.setWhat("ParameterType"); <br />
			icat.create(sessionId, rule);
		</code>
		<p>allows any authenticated user (with a sessionId) to read
			Parameters. Consider a group of users: fredReaders. To allow
			fredReaders to read a datafile with a name of "fred" we could have:</p>
		<code>
			Rule rule = new Rule(); <br /> rule.setGroup(fredReaders); <br />
			rule.setCrudFlags("R"); <br /> rule.setWhat("SELECT Datafile df
			WHERE df.name='fred'"); <br /> icat.create(sessionId, rule);
		</code>
		<p>
			The
			<code>what</code>
			field may contain almost anything which may appear as a search query.
			The query, if evaluated, would return the set of objects which can be
			read, updated or deleted in the case of R, U and D crudFlags. For the
			C crudFlag which controls create operations, the call is allowed if
			after creation of the object it would be in the set defined by the
			<code>what</code>
			field. The search query in the
			<code>what</code>
			field must return a set of objects rather than a set of fields or an
			aggregate function. The query must not contain INCLUDE, LIMIT nor
			ORDER BY clauses. There is currently an important restriction to
			avoid a problem which has occured in testing: with the JPQL syntax
			only one dot may appear for terms in the WHERE clause and for the
			concise syntax no dots are allowed in the condition in square
			brackets. You will get an error message if you forget. In the example
			above the JPQL syntax is used. If preferred the concise syntax may
			also be used as shown below:
		</p>
		<code>
			Rule rule = new Rule(); <br /> rule.setGroup(fredReaders); <br />
			rule.setCrudFlags("R"); <br /> rule.setWhat("Datafile
			[name='fred']"); <br /> icat.create(sessionId, rule);
		</code>
		<p>More complex restrictions can be added using other related
			objects. For example to allow read access to Datasets belonging to an
			Investigation which includes an InvestigationUser which has a user
			with a name matching the currently authenticated user (from the
			sessionId) we can have:</p>
		<code>
			Rule rule = new Rule(); <br /> rule.setGroup(null); <br />
			rule.setCrudFlags("R"); <br /> rule.setWhat("select Dataset ds,
			ds.investigation i, i.investigationUser iu WHERE iu.name = :user"); <br />
			icat.create(sessionId, rule);
		</code>
		<p>which in the concise syntax becomes</p>
		<code>
			Rule rule = new Rule(); <br /> rule.setGroup(null); <br />
			rule.setCrudFlags("R"); <br /> rule.setWhat("Dataset &lt;-&gt;
			Investigation &lt;-&gt; InvestigationUser &lt;-&gt; User[name =
			:user]"); <br /> icat.create(sessionId, rule);
		</code>

		<p>Rules which allow everyone to read a table are cached in memory
			and are good for performance. For example:</p>
		<code>
			Rule rule = new Rule(); <br /> rule.setGroup(null); <br />
			rule.setCrudFlags("R"); <br /> rule.setWhat("DatasetType"); <br />
			icat.create(sessionId, rule);
		</code>

		<h4>PublicStep</h4>
		<p>This table has two columns (origin and field). An entry in this
			table affects the way in which INCLUDE authorizationis carried out.
			Each entry permits all users to make a step from the origin entity by
			the specifed relationship field without any further checking. This
			information is held in memory for speed. For those INCLUDEs that are
			not mentioned in the PublicStep table a full read authorization check
			must be made before including an object to be returned - which can be
			expensive.</p>

		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Checking accessibility">
		<p class="call">boolean isAccessAllowed(String sessionId,
			EntityBaseBean bean, AccessType accessType)</p>
		<p>This call returns true if the access to the bean specified by
			the accessType is permitted. For example:</p>
		<code>
			Dataset ds = new Dataset(); <br /> ds.setName("Name of dataset"); <br />
			ds.set ... <br /> System.out.println(isAccessAllowed(sessionId, ds,
			AccessType.CREATE))
		</code>
		<p>This code sets up a Dataset and then prints whether or not it
			would be allowed to create it.</p>
		<p>This call is expected to be made from GUIs so that they can
			avoid offering operations that will fail. As such, though READ acess
			may be queried it is unlikely to be useful as the GUI user will not
			have found out about the object to be checked. If READ, DELETE or
			UPDATE access is queried for an object that does not exist it will
			return false.</p>
		<p>
			In the case of CREATE, the entity is created within a database
			transaction, the check is made and the transaction is rolled back.
			Note that if a
			<tt>create</tt>
			operation would result in a duplicate this will cause an exception to
			be thrown.

	<section name="Logging">
		<p>Logging to a table with the entity name Log (and/or a file in
			the logs directory) may be enabled in the icat.properties file of the
			ICAT server. Records of the type requested in the icat.properites
			file are added to this table for each eligible call. The information
			in the table may be regarded as sensitive so appropriate
			authorization rules should be created.</p>
	</section>
	<section name="Notifications">
		<p>ICAT is able to send JMS messages for create, update and delete
			of sslected entities. This is controlled by the icat.properties file
			of the ICAT server which can specify a list of the entity types to
			consider, and for each type which action to generate a message for.
			The JMS message is always PubSub rather than point to point. This
			means that there can be multiple listeners for a message.</p>
		<p>
			Any receiver must be set up to receive messages with a topic of
			"jms/ICAT/Topic". The messages all have properties of "entity" which
			is the type of the entity such as
			<tt>Dataset</tt>
			and "operation" which is one of the letters: C, U and D (for create,
			update and delete respectively). The body of the message is an object
			which holds the entity id as a Long. For the "xxxMany" calls multiple
			notifications will be generated. A receiver typically implemented as
			an MDB (Message Driven Bean) should filter the messages it processes
			by using the properties of the message.

		</p>

		<p>It should be noted that by the time you can react to a deletion
			notification the entity id you are sent will refer to an object which
			no longer exists.</p>

		<p>This mechanism does not leak information becuase all the user
			receives is an entity id. To read the entity with that id the user
			must have read access to that entity instance.</p>

		<p>
			There is an <a
				href="http://code.google.com/p/icatproject/source/browse/contrib/notification-receiver-example">example
				MDB</a> available which should make this easier to understand.

		<p class="call">String getApiVersion()</p>

		<p>
			returns the <em>version of the server</em>

		<p class="call">List&lt;String&gt; getEntityNames()</p>

		<p>Returns an alphabetic list of all the entity names known to
			ICAT. This is of most value for tools.</p>

		<p class="call">EntityInfo getEntityInfo(String beanName)</p>


		<p>returns full information about a table given its name. For

	<section name="Administration Calls">
		<p>To be authorized to use these administration calls you must be
			authenticated with a name listed in the rootUserNames in the
			icat.properties file.</p>
		<p class="call">List&lt;String&gt; getProperties(String sessionId)
		</p>

		<p>lists the active contents of the icat.properties file. It does
			this by examining the properties after they have been read in so any
			superfluous definitions in the original properties file will not be
			seen. The current physical file is not re-examined</p>

		<p class="call">void lucenePopulate(String sessionId, String
			entityName)</p>
		<p>instructs lucene to populate indices for the specified
			entityName. This is useful if the database has been modified directly
			rather than by using the ICAT API. This call is asynchronous and
			simply places the request in a set of entity types to be populated.
			When the request is processed all lucene entries of the specified
			entity type are first cleared then the corresponding icat entries are
			scanned to re-populate lucene. To find the prcoessing state use the
			luceneGetPopulating() call desribed below. Note that because of
			caching, ICAT should ideally be reloaded after any direct database
			modifications are made.</p>

		<p class="call">List&lt;String&gt; luceneGetPopulating(String
			sessionId)</p>
		<p>returns a list of entity types to be processed for populating
			lucene following calls to lucenePopulate(). Normally the first item
			returned will be being processed currently. If nothing is returned
			then processing has completed.</p>

		<p class="call">void luceneCommit(String sessionId)</p>
		<p>instructs lucene to update indices. Normally this is not needed
			as it is will be done periodically according to the value of
			lucene.commitSeconds in the icat.properties file.</p>

		<p class="call">void luceneClear(String sessionId)</p>
		<p>clears all the lucene indices. It does not commit itself; you
			may simply wait for the periodic commit depending upon the value of
			lucene.commitSeconds in the icat.properties file.</p>

		<p class="call">List&lt;String&gt; luceneSearch(String sessionId,
			String query, int maxCount, String entityName)</p>
		<p>
			searches lucene indices and returns a list of entity_name:entity_id
			values. "query" is a lucene query. Queries can contain AND and OR in
			upper case as well as parentheses. The default operator is OR.
			Wildcards of * and ? are also supported. Other features are described
			for the <a href="#searchText">searchText</a> call. The maxCount
			argument specifies the maximum number of values to return and the
			entityName, if not null, restricts results to entities with that
			name.
